Readme
======
run_analysis.R
--------------
This code reads in the "test" and "train" datasets from the UCI HAR Dataset.  The two datasets are merged and then the averages of a selected set of variables for each activity and subject are outputted into a text file.
The code assumes that a folder called "UCI HAR Dataset" is in the working directory and within that there are two folders, called "test" and "train" that each contain 3 files containg subject id's, activity id's and the data.
The variables to be output are selected by using a search on the words "mean()" and "std()".  Note that the search is implemented in a way to exclude variables containing teh terms meanFreq.
The variable names are tidied up according to the ideal format given in the lecture notes, i.e set to lower case and undescores, parentheses are removed.
The means for each variable are calulated using the dplyr package so this must be installed for this code to run.

load\_UCIHAR(dataset, meanstd.var\_names,column.names)
-------------------------------------------------------
This is a helper function called from run_analysis.R in order to load the "test" and "train" datasets.
inputs:
  - dataset, a character that is either "test" or "train"
  - meanstd.var_names, a vector that determines which of the variable columns of the dataste to retain.
  - column.names, a character vector with the names of the retained columns.
  
  output:
    - a dataframe containing the selected variables.  The first column gives the activity and the second column give the subject ID.
